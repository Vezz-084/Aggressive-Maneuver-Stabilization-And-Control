### Geometric Tracking Controller

#### Overview
The **Geometric Tracking Controller** operates on the \( SE(3) \) manifold, combining translational and rotational control for quadrotor UAVs. It ensures global stability and precise trajectory tracking, avoiding the limitations of Euler angles.

#### Features
- **Nonlinear Control on \( SE(3) \)**: Directly tracks position and orientation on nonlinear manifolds.
- **Singularity Avoidance**: Eliminates issues such as gimbal lock.
- **Robust to Aggressive Maneuvers**: Ideal for high-speed and large-rotation trajectories.

#### Key Algorithms
- Position and velocity error dynamics:
  - \( e_x = x - x_d \), \( e_v = \dot{x} - \dot{x}_d \)
- Control law for thrust:
  - \( F = -k_x \cdot e_x - k_v \cdot e_v + m \cdot \ddot{x}_d + m \cdot g \cdot e_3 \)
- Rotational dynamics using the desired rotation matrix.

#### Applications
- UAVs requiring precise trajectory tracking in dynamic environments.
- High-performance tasks like inspection and delivery.
