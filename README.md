# Aggressive Maneuver Stabilization and Control

**Aggressive Maneuver Stabilization and Control** (AMSC) is a cutting-edge project designed to enhance the stability and control of vehicles (aerial, ground, or marine) during aggressive and high-speed maneuvers. With applications in both autonomous and manually controlled systems, this project leverages advanced algorithms to maintain optimal performance even in challenging conditions.

This repository includes the core algorithms, simulation tools, and code necessary for stabilizing and controlling vehicles during high-intensity maneuvers.

## Features

- **Advanced Stabilization Algorithms:** Using real-time sensor data and control loops, the system ensures the vehicle maintains stability during aggressive movements.
- **Real-Time Control System:** The project implements a control system that adjusts the vehicleâ€™s behavior instantly, keeping the trajectory within desired parameters.
- **High Maneuverability Support:** Designed to support vehicles with high maneuverability demands, such as drones, racing cars, and other vehicles prone to instability during extreme conditions.
- **Simulation and Testing Framework:** Test the control algorithms in a simulated environment before deploying to real-world systems.

## Key Algorithms

- **Proportional-Derivative-Integral (PID) Control:** Adjusts vehicle inputs to ensure smooth and stable maneuvers by compensating for any errors in position or orientation.
- **LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator):** Optimizes control for minimizing energy usage while ensuring stability.
- **State Estimation Algorithms:** Use sensor data to estimate the current state of the system (e.g., velocity, orientation) and feed it into the control loop for real-time adjustments.
- **Adaptive Control Methods:** Adjusts control parameters dynamically depending on the maneuver characteristics and external disturbances.
