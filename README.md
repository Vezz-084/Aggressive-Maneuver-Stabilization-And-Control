# Aggressive Maneuver Stabilization and Control (AMSC)

This repository is dedicated to the development and implementation of a robust quaternion-based control system for quadrotor UAVs. Specifically designed for aggressive maneuvers, this system ensures global stability and precise attitude tracking in dynamic environments. Leveraging advanced geometric tracking control on \( SE(3) \) and quaternion-based attitude control, the project addresses challenges like gimbal lock, nonlinear dynamics, and high-rotation maneuvers.

## Project Motivation

Conventional control techniques often fail during aggressive UAV maneuvers due to limitations like singularities, noise sensitivity, and computational complexity. This project aims to:

- Overcome these limitations by integrating quaternion-based control for robust attitude tracking.
- Develop a hybrid control system that combines geometric and quaternion-based approaches.

This work has applications in aerial robotics for **search and rescue**, **surveillance**, and **industrial inspection**.

## Features

- **Hybrid Control Framework**: Combines **Geometric Tracking Control** on \( SE(3) \) for position and altitude tracking and **Quaternion-Based Attitude Control** for orientation stabilization.
- **Simulation of Aggressive Maneuvers**: Includes scenarios such as 360-degree flips and helical trajectories.
- **High Precision Tracking**: Achieves minimal position and velocity errors even during aggressive maneuvers.

## Key Algorithms

1. **Geometric Tracking Control on \( SE(3) \)**:
   - Operates directly on nonlinear manifolds.
   - Ensures global stability and avoids singularities.

2. **Quaternion-Based Attitude Control**:
   - Singularities-free orientation control using compact quaternion representation.
   - Computationally efficient and precise during high-rotation dynamics.

3. **Hybrid Approach**:
   - Combines the strengths of both approaches to balance altitude and attitude control.

## Implementation Details

- **Platform**: MATLAB/Simulink for simulation and control algorithm development.
- **Test Scenarios**: Includes trajectory tracking for:
  - **Flip Maneuver**: Large rotational displacements over a short duration.
  - **Helical Trajectory**: Smooth circular motion with progressive ascent.
- **Control Inputs**:
  - Altitude Controller: Generates thrust \( F \).
  - Attitude Controller: Computes torque \( \tau \) using quaternion-based feedback.
