### Quaternion-Based Controller

#### Overview
The **Quaternion-Based Controller** ensures precise and robust attitude control for quadrotor UAVs by leveraging quaternions for orientation representation. Quaternions avoid singularities and reduce computational complexity, making them ideal for dynamic and aggressive maneuvers.

#### Features
- **Singularity-Free Attitude Control**: Avoids gimbal lock using quaternion-based orientation representation.
- **Lightweight Computation**: Requires fewer parameters than traditional rotation matrices.
- **Robust Stability**: Handles large angular displacements with high precision.

#### Key Algorithms
- Quaternion error calculation.
- Feedback control law:
  - \( \tau = -K_q \cdot q_{\text{err}} - K_\omega \cdot \omega \)
- Angular velocity dynamics:
  - \( \dot{\omega} = J^{-1} \left( \tau - \omega \times (J \cdot \omega) \right) \)

#### Applications
- Dynamic maneuvers requiring smooth orientation transitions.
- UAV operations in environments with significant disturbances.
